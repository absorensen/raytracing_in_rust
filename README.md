# raytracing_in_rust
A path tracer based on Peter Shirleys books. INSERT LINK
I tried to take the end of the third book as a jumping off point for learning more about Rust and various quality of life improvements and performance enhancements. I added a UI with egui INSERT LINK and increased performance with ultraviolet INSERT LINK. Ultimately, as I wanted to implement more advanced topics, the overly paedagogical architecture from Peter Shirleys books proved to be hard to continue to adapt without massive changes. 

It was a great experience and can wholeheartedly be recommended. I will be moving on with a small path tracer for learning and implementing optimal light transport and perhaps an implementation of pbrt in Rust.
